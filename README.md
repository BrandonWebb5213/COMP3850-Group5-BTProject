# COMP3850-Group5-BTfinancialProject

To find files relating to the web design side of the project, 
you can navigate to the 'frontend' folder.

When we eventually create them, files relating to the ESG database
will be placed in the 'backend' folder.

To run the website, you will need to run it in a live server rather 
than simply clicking on the index file.

If you're at all confused about the files in this repository, feel
free to ask me for help.
